# HangManConsoleGame

In it's current state, this program takes in input from one user then outputs an empty gallows with empty lines directly 
underneath for another user to "fill in the blank" with by guessing letters.

The player guessing gets 7 tries before the a full man is drawn on the gallows. Once that happens, you lose. Whether you win or lose, the
program will ask if you want to play again.
